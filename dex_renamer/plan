strings start at 0x70
need to change everything 0x38 and up.
repoint all offsets accordingly.

so, load all section offsets and lengths.
Done

work wiht them individually
problem: all of them point to somewhere in data folder, not necessarily chronological order.
need absolute offset of all of them.
every string is findable via: 
string_ids_off + string_data_off which is an address in data.
if we want to keep with section then we find every string like so:
data[string_ids_off + string_data_off - data_off]


put them back together
rebuild header file with recalculated pointers.
reclaculate checksum
recalculate sha1 signature.
